# Intro
I recently created a filter bar using the popular [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) libraries in React. For this post, we're going to create a filter bar in a standard contacts page, where the contacts will be filtered by individual's name.

Here is an example of how the contacts page will look with the filter. ![Contact Filter](/static/contact-page.png)
