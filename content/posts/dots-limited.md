Like most of the world, I've become more interested in NFTs over the past few months. From billion dollar behemoths like [BAYC](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) to new entrants like [Bushidos](https://opensea.io/collection/bushidos) the space is booming and shows no time of slowing down in the immediate future. Realizing the growth potential in the space, I decided to sit down and make some NFTs of my own. Only one problem presented itself - how do I make the JPEGs to mint? 

Having spent a few hours over the previous weekend learning about generative art using [p5js](https://p5js.org/), I decided to make my own art and learn how to mint NFTs on Opensea! Two birds, one stone. 

I decided to replicate my partner's latest purchase of a dot print for our entryway using [p5js](https://p5js.org/) while lazy minting on Opensea to avoid gas costs.
